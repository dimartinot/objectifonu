The purpose of this project is to provide firefighters with an application that provides their foreign detachment(s) with wider manoeuvring lines, thus facilitating mission coordination. This application should enable firemen to access information on the country of deployment quickly and efficiently.  The application is also asked to offer geolocation, with the identification of points of interest. Finally, the last point: the application must allow the transmission of information between the different members of the detachment, by text, audio or image, and this project responds to a number of constraints related to the organization of the detachment: the latter must include different levels of access according to the profiles, this being defined by the ranks occupied by the members of the detachment. In addition to all this, it is important to ensure that the application works as expected on IOS and Android mobile devices.
